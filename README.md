# Calendar--JavaScript-HTML-CSS
This is a calendar project that allows you select and deselect days. You can even toggle between dark mode and light mode. I did a JavaScript course named learnjavascript.online and there is a Project course as well. This is the best project taken from that full 30 project course.
It is very smooth, user friendly, and simple.
